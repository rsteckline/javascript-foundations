# JavaScript Foundations

Each exercise emphasizes the fundamentals of functional programming in JavaScript.

## Installation Steps

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Type `cd javascript-foundations` to move into the root directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Test that the unit tests are working by running the command `npm test mythical-creatures/test/dragon-test.js` in your terminal

You should see something like:

```shell
> foundations@1.0.0 test
> mocha mythical-creatures/test/dragon-test.js

  Dragon
    - should be able to create a dragon with a name
    - should be able to have a different name
    - should have a rider

### Make sure to read each subdirectory's README carefully before starting

## Overview
Completing the same test suite over and over will cause memorization and pattern matching to kick in which isn't what isn't beneficial. These test suites should be improving problem solving skills. If you solve without reading the full test, it’s time for a new test suite. Be strategic about how you use these.

It's best to unskip each test, one at a time in order. Unskip the test by deleting the `.skip` from the test's first line. Run the test to see what kind of error is displayed, and then implement the code to make the test pass.
